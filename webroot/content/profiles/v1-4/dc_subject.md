Normally keywords, phrases or classification codes are used to describe the topic of *the resource*. If using free text, the use of general keywords **SHOULD** be avoided. It is **RECOMMENDED** to use a formal classification scheme or controlled vocabulary e.g [Library of Congress Classification Headings](http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/) or [Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/). When including terms from multiple vocabularies, separate instances of this element **MUST** be used. If multiple vocabulary terms or keywords are used, terms **SHOULD** be separated with one of the following approaches:

* the use of semi-colons to separate individual terms

or

* the use of separate iterations of this element for each term
