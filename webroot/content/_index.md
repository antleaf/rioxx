This website contains the technical specifications for Rioxx, with some supporting information. Rioxx is a metadata profile, designed to aid open-access repositories to share metadata about the scholarly resources they contain.

Rioxx is recommended for use as a "format" in OAI-PMH, but it has also been updated to work well with more modern Web protocols too. It has been optimised to better enable the harvesting of metadata from distributed repositories by services (such as aggregation services).

#### For more information:
