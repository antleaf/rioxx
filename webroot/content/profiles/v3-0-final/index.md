## Terminology

*the primary resource* refers to the thing being described by the Rioxx record.

*the resource* refers to resources that are not the *primary resource*. A *resource* can encompass resource identifiers (i.e. URIs), such as persistent identifiers.

*landing page* refers to an entry page on a repository or publication platform that describes the *primary resource* and provides links to related *resources*. 

*custodianship* refers to the concept that the location of a *primary resource* and a *resource* is significant to understanding the nature of the thing being described by the Rioxx record and is relevant to machine processing of Rioxx metadata. Resources under *direct custodianship* are those which are under direct management of a local repository or publication platform, and under which that local system controls and maintains file content and/or other *resources*. Resources outside this *direct custodianship* (e.g. resources at or hosted by third party services) demonstrate *external custodianship*. 

The terms **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** used in the table below should be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
