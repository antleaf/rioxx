Coverage (`dc:coverage`) will typically include a temporal period (a period label, date, or date range) or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity).

In line with the [Openaire Guidelines, which recommends the inclusion of this property](https://guidelines.openaire.eu/wiki/Literature_Guidelines:_Metadata_Field_Coverage), `dc:coverage` is also considered a **RECOMMENDED** property in Rioxx.
