This is defined in the [NISO Open Access Metadata and Indicators](http://www.niso.org/workrooms/ali/). This element **MUST** take an HTTP URI for its value. This HTTP URI **MUST** point to a resource which expresses the license terms specifying how *the resource* may be used.

This element **MUST** include the attribute:

* start_date

This attribute takes a date value which **MUST** be encoded using ISO 8601 (post&#8211;2004 versions) which follows the following format: YYYY-MM-DD.

This attribute is used to indicate the date upon which this license takes effect. Multiple *ali:license_ref* elements may be included. Where several such elements are included, the one with the *start_date* attribute indicating the most recent date takes precedence.

Example:
    
    <ali:license_ref start_date="2015-02-17">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0</ali:license_ref>

This approach allows the expression of &#39;embargoes&#39;, where a particular license takes effect at a date in the subjective future.

In the absence of any other license, the copyright holder reserves all rights automatically. As a convenience, RIOXX provides two URLs which may be used to explicitly convey this state:

* [http://www.rioxx.net/licenses/all-rights-reserved](/licenses/all-rights-reserved)
* [http://www.rioxx.net/licenses/under-embargo-all-rights-reserved](/licenses/under-embargo-all-rights-reserved)
