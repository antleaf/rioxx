This field MUST contain a globally unique and persistent identifier for the published version of *the resource*. The identifier SHOULD be an HTTP URI that can be de-referenced (and is, thus, &#34;actionable&#34;). If a DOI has been issued by the publisher then this *MUST* be used. Such a DOI **MUST** be represented in its HTTP form, for example:

    <rioxxterms:version-of-record>
        http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1995.0238
    </rioxxterms:version-of-record>
