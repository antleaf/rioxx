The format of this element **MUST** be an HTTP URI which points to a related resource, e.g. a research data-set which underpins *the resource*. An exception to this is the DOI identifying the related 'version of record' - this **MUST** be recorded in the *rioxxterms:version_of_record* element.

Each related resource **MUST** appear as a separate instance of the field.
