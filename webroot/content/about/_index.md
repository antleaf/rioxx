Rioxx has been developed for institutional repositories to share metadata about the scholarly resources they contain. Originally designed to meet the reporting requirements of [Research Councils UK (RCUK)](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk), Rioxx has
also proven to be generally useful as a standard for sharing metadata between repositories and network services such as large-scale metadata aggregators (e.g. [Core](http://www.core.ac.uk)).

Rioxx focuses on applying consistency to the metadata fields used for identifiers of scholarly outputs, people and organisations, research funders and project/grants, and is designed to support the consistent tracking of open-access
research publications across scholarly systems.

Rioxx is governed by the [Rioxx Governance Group](/governance), appointed by [UKCORR](https://www.ukcorr.org). This website was designed and is hosted by Paul Walk of [Antleaf](https://www.antleaf.com).

## History

The RIOXX metadata application profile was originally developed by Paul Walk (while at [UKOLN][2]) and then [EDINA][1]) and by Sheridan Brown (Chygrove Ltd), working closely with [RCUK][3] who acted as sponsor and in collaboration
with [HEFCE][4] who supported and endorsed this work. This original work was funded and supported by [Jisc][5].
