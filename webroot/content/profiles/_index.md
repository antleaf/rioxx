#### [Version 3.0 (DRAFT)](/profiles/v3-0-final/)
###### Changes since [Version 2.0 Final Release:](/profiles/v2-0-final/)
<mark>THESE NEED TO BE UPDATED</mark>
- Separation of project and grant data, with the creation of `<rioxxterms:grants>` alongside `<rioxxterms:project>`
- Wider support for persistent identifier (PID) schemes across `<rioxxterms:author>`, `<rioxxterms:contributor>`, `<rioxxterms:project>` and `<dc:publisher>`, with an increased range of PID schemes recommended to reflect growing maturity in the PID landscape
- Updates to the usage of RFC 2119 terminology throughout the profile
- General improvements to language used in profile documentation
- The name of the 'RIOXX Metadata Application Profile' changed to 'Rioxx: Research Outputs Metadata Schema' to better communicate its purpose
- `<ali:license_ref>`, `<rioxxterms:author>`, `<rioxxterms:contributor>`, `<rioxxterms:project>`, `<rioxxterms:version_of_record>` **updated** to explicitly note HTTPS use where URI values are specified.
- **Removed** the `<ali:free_to_read>` property.
- **Removed** the `<rioxxterms:apc>` property.
- Addition of the a **new** property: `<rioxxterms:record_public_release_date>` encoded according to ISO8601/W3CDTF.
- `<rioxxterms:publication_date>` **updated** to specify encoding as per ISO8601/W3CDTF, including resources with seasonal publication dates.
- Controlled list of types in  `<rioxxterms:type>` **removed** and **updated** to specify the [COAR Controlled Vocabulary Resource Type Genres](http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/resource_types/).
- **Major change** to the use of `<dc:identifier>` to accommodate multiple 'expressions' of the same 'work'. In particular, introduction of  `<dc:relation>` and the parallel use of the 'uri', 'deposit_date', 'resource_exposed_date' and 'type' attributes. The 'type' attribute makes use of [schema.org](https://schema.org/) [vocabulary definitions]().
- General move away from using the XML 'id' attribute across RIOXX to uniquely identify element content using URI(s) and the introduction of the 'uri' attribute. This change specifically affects `<rioxxterms:author>`, `<rioxxterms:contributor>`, `<rioxxterms:publisher>` and `<rioxxterms:type>`.
