This website contains the technical specifications for and supporting information about Rioxx. Rioxx is a metadata profile, designed to aid repositories in sharing metadata about the scholarly resources they contain.

Rioxx is recommended for use as a "format" in OAI-PMH, but it has also been updated to work well with more modern Web protocols.

Rioxx is governed by [UKCORR](https://www.ukcorr.org), and its documentation (this website) is maintained by Paul Walk at [Antleaf](http://www.antleaf.com).
