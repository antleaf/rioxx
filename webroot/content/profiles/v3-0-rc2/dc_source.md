The source label describes a resource from which ***the resource*** is derived (in whole or in part). It is **RECOMMENDED** that the source is referenced using a unique identifier from a recognised system e.g. the unique 8-digit International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN) assigned to *electronic* periodicals, or the 13 digit International Standard Book Number (ISBN13) assigned to books. In the latter case, the ISBN13 for the electronic version of the book ***SHOULD*** be used if available.

Use of this property is applicable where ***the resource*** is to be published as part of a larger resource. Examples might include a conference paper belonging to proceedings or a chapter of a book, but not a complete book for example.
