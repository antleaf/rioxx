This website contains the technical specifications for Rioxx, with some supporting information. Rioxx is a metadata profile, designed to aid repositories in sharing metadata about the scholarly resources they contain.

Rioxx is recommended for use as a "format" in OAI-PMH, but it has also been updated to work well with more modern Web protocols.
