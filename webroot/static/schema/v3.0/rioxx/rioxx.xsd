Schema for the RIOXX Application Profile, version 2.0

Created 2015-01-21

Created by

Paul Walk (p.walk@ed.ac.uk)
Ian Stuart (ian.stuart@ed.ac.uk)

Terminology

'the resource' refers to the electronic copy of a publication held in a 
repository, and is that which is being described by the RIOXX metadata record.

'version of record' refers to the version of the publication being described
in the RIOXX metadata record which has been made available, electronically, by the publisher.

The terms MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL used in the descriptions
below should be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

Note that its cast into XSD 1.1 as XSD 1.0 has a restriction that limits all elements in 
an 'all' grouping to have a maxOccurs of zero or one.

Elements are listed in alphabetical order.

Location: The xsd file is located at http://www.rioxx.net/schema/v2.0/rioxx/rioxx.xsd

The rioxxterms:contributor property describes the party responsible for making contributions
to the content of the primary resource. This is normally a person, but may be an organisation or service.

Where available and possible, the RECOMMENDED format is to encode the name of the contributor within the sub-property
rioxxterms:name, and to include a recognised identifier in its HTTP(S) URI form using the rioxxterms:id sub-property,
e.g.

<rioxxterms:contributor>
	<rioxxterms:name>Bhopal, Kalwant</rioxxterms:name>
	<rioxxterms:id>https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3017-6595</rioxxterms:id>
</rioxxterms:contributor>
If necessary, multiple instances of rioxxterms:id may be included to communicate additional identifier schemes, e.g.

<rioxxterms:contributor>
	<rioxxterms:name>Bhopal, Kalwant</rioxxterms:name>
	<rioxxterms:id>https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3017-6595</rioxxterms:id>
	<rioxxterms:id>https://isni.org/isni/0000000038079210</rioxxterms:id>
	<rioxxterms:id>https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q61998297</rioxxterms:id>
</rioxxterms:contributor>
Where the contributor is an organisation, the RECOMMENDED format is to add the official name of the organisation
as the content of rioxxterms:contributor and to include a recognised persistent identifier scheme in its HTTP(S)
URI form within an instance of rioxxterms:id. Such an identifier scheme might include ISNI,
Research Organization Registry (ROR), VIAF or WikiData concept URI, e.g.

<rioxxterms:contributor>
	<rioxxterms:name>Stanford University</rioxxterms:name>
	<rioxxterms:id>https://isni.org/isni/0000000419368956</rioxxterms:id>

The rioxxterms:creator property describes the party responsible for creating the primary resource.
This is normally a person, but may be an organisation or service.

Where available and possible, the RECOMMENDED the name of the creator should be encoded within
the rioxxterms:name sub-property, and to include a recognised identifier in its HTTP(S) URI
form using the rioxxterms:id sub-property, e.g.

<rioxxterms:creator>
    <rioxxterms:name>Smith, Adam</rioxxterms:name>
    <rioxxterms:id>https://isni.org/isni/0000000122796642</rioxxterms:id>
</rioxxterms:creator>
If necessary, multiple instances of rioxxterms:id may be included to communicate additional identifier schemes, e.g.

<rioxxterms:creator>
    <rioxxterms:name>Fry, Hannah</rioxxterms:name>
    <rioxxterms:id>https://isni.org/isni/0000000446254946</rioxxterms:id>
    <rioxxterms:id>http://viaf.org/viaf/314908506</rioxxterms:id>
    <rioxxterms:id>https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0601-9100</rioxxterms:id>
</rioxxterms:creator>
Where an organisation requires attribution, the RECOMMENDED format is to add the official name of the organisation
as the content of rioxxterms:creator, and to include a recognised persistent identifier scheme in its HTTP(S) URI
form within rioxxterms:id. Such an identifier scheme might include ISNI, Research Organization Registry (ROR),
VIAF or WikiData concept URI, e.g.

<rioxxterms:creator>
    <rioxxterms:name>C.E.R.N.</rioxxterms:name>
    <rioxxterms:id>https://isni.org/isni/000000012156142X</rioxxterms:id>
    <rioxxterms:id>https://ror.org/01ggx4157</rioxxterms:id>
</rioxxterms:creator>
Where the rioxxterms:creator property appears multiple times for one record,
it CAN be assumed that the order is significant, in that the first element describes the first named author
of the resource. In order to make this more explicit, an extra attribute, first-named-author,
SHOULD be used to indicate which of the rioxxterms:creator elements describes the first named author of the resource,
thus:

<rioxxterms:creator first-named-author="true">
    <rioxxterms:name>Olusoga, David</rioxxterms:name>
    <rioxxterms:id>https://isni.org/isni/0000000096386112</rioxxterms:id>

Although this property is not strictly mandated in the Rioxx schema,
it SHOULD be included because this is the property which harvesting software will inspect to locate
URLs for resource file content - for example to locate the "full text" associated with a repository record.
It will also be the property to declare a persistent identifier (PID) that may be associated with the resource.

Note that only those resources under the direct custodianship of the repository should be asserted within dc:relation.
Resources demonstrating external custodianship should be related using rioxxterms:ext_relation.

dc:relation is refined by a series of attributes, which SHOULD be included (where applicable):

rel
type
coar_type
coar_version
deposit_date
resource_exposed_date
access_rights
license_ref
When set to rel="item", the dc:relation property identifies a downloadable resource.
Each such dc:relation property MUST contain an HTTP(S) URI resolving to the downloadable resource.
It is REQUIRED that this property is used whenever the Rioxx record identifies a downloadable object
under the direct custodianship of the repository, such as a full text, dataset or software.
Where such deposited downloadable resource remains under a temporary embargo,
the repository SHOULD return an appropriate HTTP status code to indicate that access to the resource is forbidden,
until the embargo's expiry. The most appropriate HTTP code to return is 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons.

When set to rel="cite-as", the dc:relation property specifies a cite-able identifier associated with the resource.

dc:relation MUST only be used to identify resources under the direct custodianship of the repository, therefore all URIs
specified under dc:relation MUST resolve to the repository. URIs identifying related resources that resolve to resources
outside of the direct custodianship of the repository MUST be specified under rioxterms:ext_relation.

The dc:relation property can be repeated to specify more than one associated resource. Possible values here may include
a DOI, URN, CORE OAI ID; or an alternative repository HTTP(S) URI where there is no requirement for a PID.

Attributes
- rel: The rel attribute uses 'typed links' from the IANA Link Relation Registry. This attribute will often be set to rel='item' where dc:relation is being used to communicate downloadable file content, but will be set to rel="cite-as" where dc:relation is simulataneously being used to declare an associated persistent identifier.
- type: The type attribute refers to the technical format of the value of dc:relation. When used, type MUST encode the Media Type of the resource (formerly MIME Type). Note that this attribute should not be confused with coar_type.
- coar_type: When used, the coar_type attribute MUST contain a value which is an identifier from the COAR Resource Types Vocabulary. For example, for the common case of the resource being a PDF of a journal article, the RECOMMENDED value would be http://purl.org/coar/resource_type/c_6501 ('journal article'). The COAR Resource Types Vocabulary accommodates a diverse range of resource types. dc:relation can therefore also be used to communicate the existence of directly harvestable related data or software, such as by types experimental data or research software.
- coar_version: When used, the coar_version attribute MUST contain a value which is an identifier from the COAR Version Types Vocabulary.
- deposit_date: The deposit_date attribute (if present) takes the date on which this resource was first deposited, irrespective of any relevant embargoes or dark archiving, and irrespective of any subsequent file replacement(s). It is anticipated that in some circumstances the deposit_date will be captured and exposed in repository metadata when the resource described is under temporary embargo or temporary dark archiving. If included, this attribute's value MUST be encoded according to the W3CDTF (a profile of ISO 8601) which typically follows the following format: YYYY-MM-DD.
- resource_exposed_date: The resource_exposed_date attribute (if present) takes the date on which this related resource was made publicly available, irrespective of any subsequent file replacement(s). If included, this attribute's value MUST be encoded according to the W3CDTF (a profile of ISO 8601) which typically follows the following format: YYYY-MM-DD. Repositories will typically fulfil resource_exposed_date if the related resource is made publicly visible immediately upon deposit, or when an applicable embargo ends.
- access_rights: When used, the access_rights attribute MUST take a URI value from the COAR Access Rights Vocabulary, which defines four access states: embargoed access, metadata only access, open access, restricted access.
- license_ref: When used, the license_ref attribute MUST communicate the license terms under which the value of rioxxterms:file is subject using an HTTP(S) URI. Typical examples might include the variety of licenses made available by Creative Commons, but can conceivably include any license referencible by URI.

The dc:source property describes a resource from which the resource is derived (in whole or in part).
It is RECOMMENDED that the source is referenced using a unique identifier from a recognised system
e.g. the unique 8-digit International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN) assigned to electronic periodicals,
or the 13 digit International Standard Book Number (ISBN13) assigned to books. In the latter case,
the ISBN13 for the electronic version of the book SHOULD be used if available.

Use of this property is applicable where the resource is to be published as part of a larger resource.
Examples might include a conference paper belonging to proceedings or a chapter of a book (but not a complete book).
