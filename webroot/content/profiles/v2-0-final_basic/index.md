This is the RIOXX 'basic' application profile version 2.0. This is **not** the [full, RCUK-approved application profile](/v2-0-final), but is a description of the basic RIOXX syntax only. The basic RIOXX application-profile is somewhat less strict than the RCUK application profile.

## Terminology

*the resource* refers to the electronic copy of a publication held in a repository, and is that which is being described by the RIOXX metadata record.

*version of record* refers to the version of the publication being described in the RIOXX metadata record which has been made available, electronically, by the publisher.

The terms **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** used in the table below should be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
