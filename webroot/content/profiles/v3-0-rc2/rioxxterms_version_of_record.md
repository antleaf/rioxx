This property **MUST** contain an HTTP(S) URI which is a persistent identifier for the published 'version of record' of ***the resource***. If a DOI has been issued by the publisher then this **MUST** be used (and such a DOI **MUST** be represented in its HTTP(S) form). For example:

```xml
<rioxxterms:version_of_record>
    https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.043015
</rioxxterms:version_of_record>
```
