This field **MUST** contain an HTTP URI which is a persistent identifier for *the resource*. The purpose of this field is, through direct identification of *the resource*, to allow access to it, therefore it is **RECOMMENDED** that this identifier should point to the *actual resource being described by the RIOXX record* (typically a file in MS Word or PDF format), rather than to an intermediary resource such as a repository web page. Note that RIOXX does not require any require particular file format to be used for *the resource*.

To describe another version of *the resource* with a different identifier, a completely separate RIOXX record should be created.
