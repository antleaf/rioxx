This refers to the title, and any sub-titles, of *the resource*. The title should be represented using the original spelling and wording. The **RECOMMENDED** format for expressing subtitles is:

`Title: Subtitle`

Note that where *the resource* is a chapter in a book, the chapter title **MUST** be entered here, with the ISBN13 of the book being recorded in the `dc:source` property.
