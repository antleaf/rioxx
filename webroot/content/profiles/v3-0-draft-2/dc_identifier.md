`dc:identifier` **MUST** contain an HTTP(S) URI which is an identifier for *the resource*. This URI should resolve to, or contain an identifier that can be resolved to, a repository 'landing page' describing this resource. The landing page should provide links to related resources. We recommend using FAIR Signposting ([signposting.org/FAIR](http://signposting.org/FAIR)) to assist machine agents in navigating from the landing page to the relevant resources.
