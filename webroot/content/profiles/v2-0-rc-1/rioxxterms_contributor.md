This field is designed to describe an entity – for example the name of a person, organisation or service – responsible for making contributions to the content of *the resource*. As many rioxxterms:contributor elements may be entered as required. This element **SHOULD** take an optional attribute called *id*, which **MUST** contain an HTTP URI which uniquely identifies the contributor. The ideal use of this element is to include both an HTTP URI in the *id* attribute, and a text string in the body of the element, thus:

    <rioxxterms:contributor id="http-uri-for-this-contributor-entity">
        name-of-this-contributor-entity
    </rioxxterms:contributor>

Where the contributor is a person, the **RECOMMENDED** format is to add text in the form Last Name, First Name(s), and to include an ORCID ID, if known, in its HTTP URI form, e.g.

    <rioxxterms:contributor id="http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1395-3092">
        Lawson, Gerald
    </rioxxterms:contributor>
