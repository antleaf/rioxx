Schema for the NISO Open Access Metadata and Indicator elements used within the RIOXX Application Profile, version 2.0

This schema only exists as the NISO schema file is not yet available

Terminology

'the resource' refers to the electronic copy of a publication held in a 
repository, and is that which is being described by the RIOXX metadata record.

'version of record' refers to the version of the publication being described
in the RIOXX metadata record which has been made available, electronically, by the publisher.

The terms MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL used in the descriptions
below should be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

Note that its cast into XSD 1.1 as XSD 1.0

This is defined in the NISO Open Access Metadata and Indicators (http://www.niso.org/workrooms/oami/)

This element does not take a value. The semantics of _ali:free_to_read_ are conveyed
by its presence or absence. This element may be modified by two optional attributes:

* start_date
* end_date

Each of these attributes, if present, takes a date value which MUST be encoded using ISO 8601
(post–2004 versions) which follows the following format: YYYY-MM-DD. Examples:


    <free_to_read start_date="2013-03-28" end_date="2014-04-30">
    <free_to_read start_date="2013-03-28">
    <free_to_read>
    
The absence of a _start_date_ attribute implies that the ali:free_to_read status is current and 
immediate, unless an _end_date_ attribute which is a date in the subjective past, is present
in the element.

This is defined in the NISO Open Access Metadata and Indicators (http://www.niso.org/workrooms/oami/). 
This element MUST take an HTTP URI for its value. This HTTP URI MUST point to a resource
which expresses the license terms specifying how the resource may be used.

This element MUST include the attribute:

*start_date

This attribute takes a date value which MUST be encoded using ISO 8601 (post–2004 versions) which
follows the following format: YYYY-MM-DD.

This attribute is used to indicate the date upon which this license takes effect. Multiple
*ali:license_ref* elements may be included. Where several such elements are included, the one with
the *start_date* attribute indicating the most recent date takes precendence.

Examples:

    <license_ref start_date="2015-02-17">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US</license_ref>
    
This approach allows the expression of 'embargoes', where a particular license takes effect at a date in
the subjective future.

In the absence of any other license, the copyright holder reserves all rights automatically. As a
convenience, RIOXX provides two URLs which may be used to explicitly convey this state:

* http://www.rioxx.net/licenses/all-rights-reserved
* http://www.rioxx.net/licenses/under-embargo-all-rights-reserved
