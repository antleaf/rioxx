This refers to the title, and any sub-titles, of ***the resource***. The title should be represented using the original spelling and wording. The **RECOMMENDED** format for expressing subtitles is:

    Title:Subtitle

Note that where ***the resource*** is a chapter in a book, the chapter title **MUST** be entered here, with the ISBN13 of the book being recorded in the *dc&#58;source* element.
