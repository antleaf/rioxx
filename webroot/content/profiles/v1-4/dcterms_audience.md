This field is designed to contain information about the group for which *the resource* is intended or is considered to be useful. There is no controlled vocabulary for this but sometimes creators or publishers indicate the intended audience. <del>Note that the Research Outcomes System (ROS) used by most of the UKâ€™s Research Councils tracks whether a resource is for a &#34;non-academic audience&#34; (with a drop-down list of possible selections) and whether a resource is for an &#34;international audience&#34;. In the absence of alternative formal vocabularies, following the ROS lead is a reasonable course of action.</del>
