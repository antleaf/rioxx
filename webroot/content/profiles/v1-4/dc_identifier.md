This field **MUST** contain a globally unique and persistent identifier for *the resource*. The identifier **SHOULD** be an HTTP URI that can be de-referenced (and is, thus, &#34;actionable&#34;). The purpose of this field is to allow access to *the resource*, therefore it is **RECOMMENDED** that this identifier should point to the *actual resource being described by the RIOXX record* (typically a PDF file), rather than to an intermediary resource such as a repository web page.<del> This resource **SHOULD** be a version of *the resource* held in a local repository.</del>
